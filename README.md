### Code for [ProjectEuler.net problems - Math & Algorithmic challenges](https://projecteuler.net/progress=xsmet)

Problems are solved in the language I deem most appropriate or want to practice. Usual suspects include but are not limited to
* JavaScript (opens and runs in any browser on any device)
* Python (flexible, runs on any command line, and has better numeric/scientific support than e.g. bash)
* C++ (if it needs to run FAST, but requires compilation)
* Java (often my language of choice, though not usually for math problems)
